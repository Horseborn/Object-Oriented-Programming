            <p> <b>W</b>e’re down to the most complex word! Polymorphism means “many shapes” in Greek.
 
             So we already know the power of inheritance and happily use it. But there comes this problem. <br>
 
             <b>S</b>ay we have a parent class and a few child classes which inherit from it. Sometimes we want to use a collection — for example a list — which contains a mix of all these classes. Or we have a method implemented for the parent class — but we’d like to use it for the children, too.
 
             This can be solved by using polymorphism. <br>
             
             <b>S</b>imply put, polymorphism gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there’s no confusion with mixing types. But each child class keeps its own methods as they are.
 
             This typically happens by defining a (parent) interface to be reused. It outlines a bunch of common methods. Then, each child class implements its own version of these methods. <br>
 
             <b>A</b>ny time a collection (such as a list) or a method expects an instance of the parent (where common methods are outlined), the language takes care of evaluating the right implementation of the common method — regardless of which child is passed. <br>

             <b>T</b>ake a look at a sketch of geometric figures implementation. They reuse a common interface for calculating surface area and perimeter:

            <b>H</b>aving these three figures inheriting the parent Figure Interface lets you create a list of mixed triangles, circles, and rectangles. And treat them like the same type of object. <br>

            <b>T</b>hen, if this list attempts to calculate the surface for an element, the correct method is found and executed. <br> If the element is a triangle, triangle’s CalculateSurface() is called. If it’s a circle — then circle’s CalculateSurface() is called. And so on. <br>

        <br>  <b>I</b>f you have a function which operates with a figure by using its parameter, you don’t have to define it three times — once for a triangle, a circle, and a rectangle. <br>
